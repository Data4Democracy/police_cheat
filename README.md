# Police Cheat

## Mission

    To find the truth about police interaction: 
     - What is the extent of racially influenced violence and incarceration? 
     - If so, what does is come from? Numbers of interactions vs chance of outcome, etc. 
     - What are the best methods of behavior to lessen poor police outcome?

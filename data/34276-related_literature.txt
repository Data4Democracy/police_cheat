This report from the U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS), presents information on the number of persons who
requested police assistance in fiscal year (FY) 2011. Highlights of the
findings include the following: an estimated 1 in 8 U.S. residents age 16
or older, or 31.4 million persons, requested assistance from police at
least once, primarily to report a crime, suspicious activity, or
neighborhood disturbance; the majority of persons who requested police
assistance felt the officers acted properly (93 percent) and were helpful
(86 percent), while about 85 percent of persons who requested police
assistance were satisfied with the police response; and no statistical
differences were found between the percentage of Hispanics (86 percent),
Blacks (85 percent), and Whites (83 percent) who reported a crime or
neighborhood disturbance and felt the police were helpful. The study also
found that 93 percent of persons who requested police assistance felt the
officers spent an appropriate amount of time with them during the contact,
and the majority of persons who requested police assistance reported that
they were just as likely or more likely to contact the police again for a
similar problem. This report was compiled to examine the characteristics
and experiences of persons who contacted law enforcement for assistance
during FY 2011. Data for the report were obtained from BJS’s 2011 Police-
Public Contact Survey, a supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey. Tables, figure, and appendixes

Presents data on the threat or use of nonfatal force by police against
white, black, and Hispanic residents during police contact. This report
describes the characteristics of the contact, the type of force threatened
or used, and the perceptions that force was excessive or the police behaved
properly during the contact. It also examines trends in the threat or use
of force and the relationship between officer and driver race and Hispanic
origin in traffic stops involving the threat or use of force. Data are from
the 2002, 2005, 2008, and 2011 Police-Public Contact Surveys, which were
administered as supplements to the National Crime Victimization Survey.

Examines the characteristics and experiences of persons age 16 or older who
were stopped by police during traffic and street stops, and their
perceptions of police behavior and response during these encounters. It
describes the outcomes of traffic and street stops by the reason for the
stop; demographic characteristics of the persons stopped; race or Hispanic
origin of the officers; and whether a ticket was issued, a search was
conducted, or force was used. It also describes variations in perceptions
of the police across characteristics and outcomes of traffic and street
stops. Data are from the 2011 Police-Public Contact Survey, a supplement to
the National Crime Victimization Survey, which collects information from a
nationally representative sample of persons in U.S. households on contact
with police during a 12-month period.
